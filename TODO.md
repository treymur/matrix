- Templates (CURRENT BRANCH)
    - Input all containers instead of just vectors
        - [Look at](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48962076/extracting-a-part-of-an-stdinitializer-listt-c)
    - Input data with any number type
    - Make sure to [check type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_assert) (in \<type_traits\>)
    - New functions:
        - Matrix to Vector (when 1 row or column, start with vectors)
        - Vector to Matrix (both horizontal and vertical)
        - When done, all multiplication outputs to be Matrix
        - Augment matrix
- New functions
    - Power function
    - Operator- function
    - Constant vector function (what A^inf * k aproaches)
        - If non, output 0 vector
        - Make sum == 1 (just append row of 1s before rref)
- Change all ULL_int to size_t
- Create custom throw paremeters
    - Check through and remove unessisary empty checks/throws
- OUTPUT SETTINGS
    - Fix set_floating_point()
    - Move default settings into .h
- Eigen stuff
    - Complex numbers
- Convert to a static library
- Prevent need for \<vector\> ??
    - Replace vector input with container
    - Replace \_data as array rather than vector
        - Reimpliment constructors
        - Deconstructor
