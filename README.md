# Matrix Library
Matrix library in C++ to use for matrix calculations and operations!

This is only a side project for me to gain a better understand of C++ and linear algebra.  
If you have any suggestions, please feel free to raise them as an issue, I will not accept any pull requests for the sake of my own learning.
